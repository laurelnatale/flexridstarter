flexridstarter
==============

A Starter kit using the FlexGrid from http://ptb2.me/flexgrid/.

This start kit is for rapid building of websites using the FlexGrid system created by Peter T. Bosse II.
You can find all the documentation for the grid system at the url listed above.

I am adding other components to this system such as CSS buttons, responsive tabs and menus, and css animated grid layouts.
This kit uses Sass and already containers starter partials for colors, fonts, and media queries.

Along with the scss and javascripts, the kit contains html files for the added components so you can see the buttons,
tabs, etc.. in action and be able to duplicate so that you can modify and add to your site. 

New componments are always being added and so this kit is a constant work in progress.
